# Benchmark

The definition from the Oxford English Dictionary states that a benchmark is _"To evaluate or check (something) by comparison with an established standard"_.

In computing, a benchmark is the act of running a computer program, a set of programs, or other operations, in order to assess the relative performance of an object, normally by running a number of standard tests and trials against it.
